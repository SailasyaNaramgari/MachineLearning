# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
## Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented o provide a comprehensive understanding of their inner workings. 

## Contents
The repository includes the following algorithms:

Find-S Algorithm: A simple algorithm used in machine learning for finding the most specific hypothesis that fits all positive examples.
Candidate Elimination Algorithm: A concept learning algorithm that incrementally builds the version space by considering each training example.
Decision Trees: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A computing system inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains, useful for pattern recognition.
Linear Regression: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Logistic Regression: A statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.
